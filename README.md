This is the first challenge of the 30 Day JS challenge. I will only do the first one which is to build a simple website from scratch that plays drum sounds according to keypress. The UI should look good, I might cry after doing this so wish me luck!

-Thanks to Wes Bos for making this challenge. (& providing sounds)
-Thanks to TheOdinProject for guiding me through Javascript

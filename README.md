This is the first challenge of the 30 Day JS challenge. I will only do the first one which is to build a simple website from scratch that plays drum sounds according to keypress. The UI should look good, I might cry after doing this so wish me luck!

-Thanks to Wes Bos for making this challenge. (& providing sounds)
-Thanks to TheOdinProject for guiding me through Javascript

LEARNINGS & IMPLEMENTATIONS:
- The HTML and CSS took the longest time to do (but I'm really proud of the design!)
- for the JS implementation, I had to follow the video because document.querySelector(`$..`) is a thing, the ` and $ symbols were ways of selecting the key which matches the key pressed. This was wayy easier than my initial plan of checking each key which matches or some other ways.

- Overall, cool, fun, I like music stuff
